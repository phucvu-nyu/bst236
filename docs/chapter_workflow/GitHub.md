# What is GitHub

- A web-based platform that uses Git, a version control system, to allow people to collaborate, store, manage, and share code. (Google tells me this)

- A social media where you can stalk, and even contribute, to others' work.

- A place where you upload your projects so other people can see and use your codes.

# Register a GitHub account

# GitHub repositories

- Each Repository is a project [One of mine](https://github.com/phucvu-nyu/Introduction-to-statistical-learning)
- Therefore Your GitHub page is basically a collection of your projects [My Page](https://github.com/phucvu-nyu)
- You can decide whether to let other see your project (public repository) or not (private repository)
