# Motivation:
1. GitHub is important if you want to work as a researcher or a data scientist/analyst<br>
2. Coming from a pharmaceutical background, I had a hard time understanding GitHub<br>
3. This webpage was created as an attempt to help/encourage beginners without prior exposure to GitHub and Git to grasp the fundamental concepts under two hours (It took me a few week learning these thing on my own)<br>

# Overview

1. You can post your awesome homeworks or scientific researchs on GitHub to share with everyone<br>
2. You can collaborate with others via GitHub
3. You will always have a clear history of who did what on your project
