# GitHub Repository
In this part, we will talk about:<br>
1. Types of projects should be put on GitHub
2. Common structure of a data analysis project


## Criteria
Any project that demonstrate your passion and your ability as a Biostatistician/ Data Science <br>
You can pin the important projects. When you do this, always keep in mind who is your target audience <br>
1. Data analysis project [My Final project for the course R Intermediate at NYU](https://github.com/phucvu-nyu/Covid-19-GDP-and-Healthcare-worker)<br>
2. Data visualization project [The code to generate the Map of current recruiting cancer trials](https://github.com/phucvu-nyu/clinical_site_map) [The map](https://phucvu-nyu.github.io/clinical_site_map/)<br>
3. Self learning/ Class notes[My notes on reading the book: An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://github.com/phucvu-nyu/Introduction-to-statistical-learning)<br>
4. Research project [ENAR DataFest project](https://github.com/phucvu-nyu/ENAR-DataFest)<br>
5. A website: [The code for this website](https://github.com/phucvu-nyu/bst236)<br>
6. A book/course: [The code for Introduction to Data Science at Harvard](https://github.com/rafalab/dsbook)<br>
7. A python/R package: [The source code for the package dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr)<br>
## Minimum Structure of a Data Analysis project on GitHub
