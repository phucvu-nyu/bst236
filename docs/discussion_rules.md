# Workflow for Questions and Discussions

## Content Questions

### "I have a question about the content taught in class."

**Best Option:**
1. Ask AI first
2. If still confused, post your question on [Github Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/hsph-bst236/discussions) under the "Lectures" category, we will answer you.


**Alternatives:**
- Visit a TA in office hours
- Visit Prof. Lu in office hours

### "I have a question about the syllabus/deadline and other logistics of the class."

**Best Option:**
- Post on [Github Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/hsph-bst236/discussions) under the "Logistics" category, we will answer you.

### "I want to share useful resources, latest AI news, my generative AI results, funny coding memes, to the class."

**Best Option:**
- Post on [Github Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/hsph-bst236/discussions) under the "Misc" category.
- Do not share the content irrelevant to the class.

## Homework Help

### "I need help on the homework."

**Best Option:**
- Ask AI first
- Discuss with your squadmates
- If still unsolved, post an issue on the homework repository.
- For coding or mathematics questions you don't want classmates to see (though we encourage an open-source spirit with everything we do in this class):
  - Send an email to a TA on your question

This is the workflow how you communicate with other programmers in the world. So we want you to get familiar with it.


**How to post an issue on the homework repository:**
- Go to the homework repository
- Click on the "Issues" tab
- Click on the "New issue" button
- Provide a Clear Title: Summarize the issue concisely in the "Title" field.
- Write a Detailed Description: In the comment body, include:
  - Description: Explain the problem or suggestion in detail.
  - Steps to Reproduce: List the steps to replicate the issue.
  - Expected Behavior: Describe what you expected to happen.
  - Actual Behavior: Explain what actually occurred.
  - Add Visuals (if necessary): Attach screenshots or logs to illustrate the issue.
- Click on the "Submit new issue" button

**Alternative:**
- Visit a TA in office hours

### Homework Clarifications

For questions like:
- "I need clarifications on the homework"
- "How will you grade part X of the homework?"
- "Do I need _____ for part X of the homework?"
- "Will you take off points if I do _____ for part X of the homework?"
- "I feel like this part of the homework is unfair/incorrect/buggy. Can you change it?"

**Best Option:**
- Post on Issue - We will answer you

**❌ DO NOT:**
- Ask Instructor or a TA individually

> **Important Note:** We try to avoid situations where one TA provides an answer/clarification to one student that other students may not be aware of. This can lead to incorrect information being shared. Only clarifications posted publicly on Github are official.

## Grade Disputes

### "I feel like I was graded incorrectly/unfairly."

**Best Option:**
1. Contact the TA first
2. If after talking to the TA who graded you, you still feel you deserve a different grade, contact the instructor
