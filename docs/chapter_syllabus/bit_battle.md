## What's a Bit Battle? 

A Bit Battle is a thrilling competition where code squads compete to write the most efficient, precise, and elegant solutions to challenging problems. It will be specified in some homework. Think of it as the Olympics of coding, but with more caffeine and fewer physical injuries! 🏃‍♂️💻

## The $byte Economy 101

- Every squad starts with a shiny deposit of ₿100 bytes 💰
- This virtual currency can be used for... well, bragging rights mostly! 
- Squad can use the $byte to buy more late days. The current price is ₿5 = 1 hour.
- You can buy late days using your current $byte balance whenever you run up your late days. Please write at the head of your homework ReadME.md file in the format: XX late days used for this homework, and XX days remained. We use XX $byte to buy XX late days.

### Battle Rewards
For each Bit Battle challenge, squads will be rewarded based on their rank:

- 🥇 1st Place: ₿100 bytes
- 🥈 2nd Place: ₿80 bytes
- 🥉 3rd Place: ₿60 bytes
- 4th Place: ₿40 bytes
- 5th Place: ₿20 bytes
- 6th Place: ₿10 bytes
- 7th Place: ₿5 bytes



## Bit Battle Events

Watch out for each homework for bit battle events. We will specify which part of the homework is for bit battle and what is the metric to rank the squads.


## Final Notes

Remember: The real treasure was the algorithms we optimized along the way! 

May the bytes be ever in your favor! 🎮✨

As this is the first time we do this, we may adjust the rules based on the feedback.
