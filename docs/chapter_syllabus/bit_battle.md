# Bit Battle

Welcome to the Bit Battle! 🎮 Where coding meets competition and bytes mean business!

## What's a Bit Battle? 

A Bit Battle is a thrilling competition where code squads compete to write the most efficient, precise, and elegant solutions to challenging problems. It will be specified in some homework. Think of it as the Olympics of coding, but with more caffeine and fewer physical injuries! 🏃‍♂️💻

## The $byte Economy 101

### Initial Setup
- Every student starts with a shiny deposit of $100 bytes 💰
- Read the [Readme](https://github.com/hsph-bst236/course_currency) for how to know your balance and how to make transactions.
- This virtual currency can be used for... well, bragging rights mostly! But it counts for 5% of your final grade
- Your final bit battle grade = 5 * Quantile of your final $byte balance among all of your classmates

### Battle Rewards
For each Bit Battle challenge, squads will be rewarded based on their rank:

1. 🥇 1st Place: 30 $bytes
2. 🥈 2nd Place: 20 $bytes
3. 🥉 3rd Place: 15 $bytes
4. 4th Place: 10 $bytes
5. 5th Place: 8 $bytes
6. 6th Place: 6 $bytes
7. 7th Place: 4 $bytes



## The Rules of Engagement

### Distribution Rules
- By default, we will award $byte rewards evenly among squad members
- Squad members can negotiate different distributions based on contributions
- We design the [transaction system](https://github.com/hsph-bst236/course_currency) so you can only send $byte to other people.
- No peer pressure allowed! We're here to have fun and learn 😊

### Trading Rules
- $bytes can only be traded between members of the same squad
- All transactions must state the reason for the transaction. You can check the [Readme](https://github.com/hsph-bst236/course_currency) to use the command to add a transaction.

```
python utils/add_transaction.py user1 user2 100 "Pay for contribution to smart coding in homework 1"
```

- No selling $bytes for real money (seriously, don't make us called by the SEC 😅)
- No borrowing or lending $bytes 
- The instructor and TF will be monitoring the transaction system. If you are found to be cheating, you will be disqualified from the bit battle and lose all your $bytes.

### Fair Play Guidelines
1. **No Sabotage**: Don't try to crash other people's bank account. 😠
2. **Be Sporty**: Winning is fun, but learning is the real prize 🌟
3. **Share Knowledge**: After battles, we will publicly share the code and the approach of the winning squad.
4. **Have Fun**: This is a game! Keep it light and enjoyable 🎉


## Bit Battle Events

Watch out for each homework for bit battle events. We will specify which part of the homework is for bit battle and what is the metric to rank the squads.


## Final Notes

Remember: The real treasure was the algorithms we optimized along the way! 

May the bytes be ever in your favor! 🎮✨

As this is the first time we do this, we may adjust the rules based on the feedback. If you have any questions or suggestions, please let us know on the issue board of the [course_currency](https://github.com/hsph-bst236/course_currency) repo.
